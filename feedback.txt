Nick: Program that analyses the bias of articles
The projects is small (just 2 files) but the functionality and logic was well implemented
and the concepts learned during the course were used, showing a very good understanding of them.
OOP, modules, JSON + API, Databases and analysis broght more value to the overall of the project.
My advice would be to keep working in this project and build a website for it. 

Python OOP:10/10
Modules: 9/10
Database:10/10
JSON/API:10/10
Overall: 10
